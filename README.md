# TreeHouse-Wordlists

![Moonbase](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/knd/images/e/eb/Kids_Next_Door_Moonbase.jpg/revision/latest)

Collection of Wordlists/Payloads to suit any penetration testers needs. 

For now it is just four custom wordlists but stay tuned for the rest of the custom wordlists from TreeHouse-Wordlists. I also added Blasting DB/Dictionary because I couldn't find it on GitHub easily. 

In the meantime don't forget to grab [Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings), [FuzzDB](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb) and [Payloads](https://github.com/foospidy/payloads).
